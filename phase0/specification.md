# Specification

We chose to write our specification using Agile User Stories
in and effort to design our program with the User as our main priority.

---

1. As a **User**, I want to be able to **create an account** so that I can use the application.
2. As a **User**, I want to be able to **log in** to my account so that I don’t have to create an account each time I use the application.
3. As a **User**, I want to be able to **log out** to ensure my profile is secure when accessed on a public device.
4. As a **User**, I want to be able to have my account **password protected** to ensure that my profile is secure.
5. As a **User**, I want to be able to **personalize my profile** so that the new people I meet get to know me.
6. As a **User**, I want to be able to **change the information on my profile** in case I change my mind or make a mistake in my profile. 
7. As a **User**, I want to be able to **visit other people’s profiles** so that I get to know them.
8. As a **User**, I want to be able to **initiate conversations** that interest me so that I can discuss different topics with people interested in these topics.
9. As a **User**, I want to be able to **find conversations** that interest me so that I can share ideas and meet people with similar interests.
10. As a **User**, I want to be able to **participate in conversations** so that I can bring something to the discussions and share my opinions.
11. As a **User**, I want to be able to **edit my messages** in case I don’t express myself the right way in a discussion.
12. As a **User**, I want to be able to **find conversations in my city** so that I can meet my new friends in person.
13. As a **User**, I want to be able to **find conversations happening elsewhere in the world** so that I can meet people internationally.
14. As a **User**, I want to be able to **leave conversation** in case I am not interested in participating in them anymore.
15. As a **User**, I want to be able to **add people as friends** so that I can stay in touch with them outside of a conversation.
16. As a **User**, I want to be able to **remove people as friends** so that I am not forced to stay in contact with someone who I am not interested in communicating with.
17. As a **User**, I want to be able to **discover new topics** which may interest me, so that I am not limited to a certain range of topics.
18. As a **User**, I want to be able to **filter-out topics** that I am not interested in, so that I am not repeatedly presented with topics which I am not interested in.
